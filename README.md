# FHAL-DETERMINISTIC

Deterministic game template. Unusable as of now.

GJP2 (my new deterministic physics engine) is being developed inside this project, and benchmarks indicate it just might be able to support 360000 contacts per second in a Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2120 CPU @ 3.30GHz   3.30 GHz.

Creating a co-op dungeon GGPO game in this just might be possible. Among other things.

Any help is appreciated though i am certain i won't get any.

In the offchance you wanna help, please use the discussion discord server is https://discord.gg/vdCeUpKS @me for anything. Specially for understanding some piece of code; reading code is hard and i'd happily explain how this works.
