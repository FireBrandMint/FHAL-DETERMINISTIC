# FHAL-MONOGAME

Deterministic game template. Unusable as of now.

GJP2 (my new deterministic physics engine) is being developed inside this project, and benchmarks indicate it just might be able to support 360000 contacts per second.

Any help is appreciated though i am certain i won't get any.

In the offchance you wanna help, please use this discord server https://discord.gg/vdCeUpKS to @me. Reading code is hard and i'd happily explain how this works.
