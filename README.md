# FHAL-DETERMINISTIC

Deterministic game template. Unusable as of now.

GJP2 (my new deterministic physics engine) is being developed inside this project, and benchmarks indicate it just might be able to support 360000 contacts per second in a Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2120 CPU @ 3.30GHz   3.30 GHz.

Creating a co-op dungeon GGPO game in this just might be possible. Among other things.

Any help is appreciated though i am certain i won't get any.

In the offchance you wanna help, just make a fork and contribute.

# License clarification

Though the project itself is under the apache attribution license, internal libraries might just have even more lax licenses. GJP2 for example is under the MIT license.
